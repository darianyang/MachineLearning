    "# Hugging Face\n",
    "- Provides a set of [tools](https://huggingface.co/docs) for utilizing pretrained models and deploying models (Hugging Face Spaces);\n",
    "- Most known for its `transformers` library, an open-source NLP library that provides a wide range of pre-trained models for various NLP tasks such as text classification, question-answering, and language translation;\n",
    "- Built on top of PyTorch and TensorFlow, and is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing applications;\n",
    "- Allows developers to fine-tune pre-trained models on their own data for specific tasks and domains, which can help improve model performance;\n",
    "- Offers a cloud-based platform called Hugging Face Spaces, which allows developers to train and deploy custom NLP models without needing to manage their own infrastructure."
